Fetch and display the first 10 comments and their children using the Hacker News API.
You may use any additional libraries you deem necessary.
3. Implement an infinite scroll for top stories by using a "Load more" button.
4. Ensure scroll to the bottom every time new stories are loaded.
5. Make API calls to fetch comments to fail 75% of the times, and handle the error gracefully.
